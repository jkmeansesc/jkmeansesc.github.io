### History of HCI

- Tied to history of computing
- Initial computers in research labs, took up full rooms
  - Only ever operated on by specialists/engineers/the people who built them

- As technology progressed, got smaller/more affordable, started appearing in workplaces and homes
  - A need for 'real' people to be able to operate them
- A need for a new discipline to study these issues
- HCI generally thought of as beginning in early 1980s
  - Although studies done before, that in retrospect followed 'HCI' methods and principles
  - Conferences began
    - e.g. 1983, the first ACM Human Factors in Computing Systems Conference, CHI
  - Influential textbooks
    - e.g. Trying to create an applied psychology of HCI
      - Based on knowledge from human psychology
      - Perception
      - Cognition
    - Motor function
    - For many in software design communities, first exposure to Psychology basics
    - Engineering style theories to give approx calculations of how efficiently humans would interact
    - Xerox Star - 1981
      - The first GUI computer released
      - WYSIWYG
      - Yet not a commercial success
        - Very expensive; network terminal, not personal computers
  - Emergence of the Graphical User Interface

### Broadening of HCI Topics
- ~1980s: early research often looking at efficiency
  - e.g. measure speed and accuracy
  - Lab-based studies
  - Formal experiments
- ~1990s: filed started to broaden, alongside importance of Internet
  - Emails, Web: topics related to communication
- ~2000s: mobile/portable computing
  - Real world studies 'in the wild'
  - New technologies: sensors, wearable, VR/AR...
  - Study social, emotional, cultural issues
  - "Older" forms of research haven't gone away

### Broadening Methods
- Technology pushed progress here too
  - Eye-tracking studies, EEG...
  - Large-scale studies, users' own devices
- From early lab based studies that timed tasks/counted errors
- Brought in techniques more from sociology

### HCI has Progressed in Three "Waves"

- First Wave: Psychology and Perception
- Second Wave: Organizational and Process Oriented
- Third Wave: Social and Ubiquitous
- Fourth Wave?
